  title        = {Optical dipole traps for neutral atoms},
  abstract     = {The subject of this review are atom traps based on optical dipole forces in laser fields, along with their unique features as storage devices at ultralow energies. The basic physics of the dipole interaction is discussed, and the experimental background of dipole trapping experiments is explained. Specific trapping schemes and experiments are presented, where the wide range of applications of dipole traps is explored considering particular examples.},
